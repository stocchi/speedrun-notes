The correct stats are 21/13/12/10/11/10. Feel free to take the one frame late too which has 20/12/12/10/11/10.

Take Totodile’s Berry off, if not manipulating you might want to check stats (12 attack required?)

Fight Slowpokes: spam fury cutter

The coin case glitch requires some specific DVs for the 3rd pokmeon in your party.
Either Egg or Kenya in 3rd is ~71% to work with random DVs (L6 Bellsprout is 71%*(12/16) to work, L3 Bellsprout never works), if you want to finish the run save before this next section, and if the glitch fails try different pokemons in slot3.
If it keeps failing, you might have messed up TID/box names, or you got really unlucky

pick up coin case from above (IMPORTANT)
(Equip Berry to Toto, Swap Toto with kenya) is this still needed?
walk left 1, up 1, left 2
Open pokedex, scroll with right until bellsprout, open summery to hear its cry
use coin case
walk down, left, up
talk to red (press A)
