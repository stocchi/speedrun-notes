Trainer ID manipulation: (todo:video) 
gold_gfwait_backout4_wait337(setopt)_backout10_newgame: TID = 0xD900 (55552), LID = 0xD3EC (54252), Offset (wait): 43.297, offset(wait GBI): 42.720 Offset (NG): 58.32

- -1 65433
- 0 55552
- 1 14846
- 2 02669
- 3 51957

if you want to do rng manipulations later (they are optional), start a timer on TID hard reset and confirm minutes between 1:00.50 and 1:01.50 (todo: this doesnt consider GBP fadeout, check whats the correct time) - note: just not missing the first textbox will give ss0 from TID manip, no need for timer

Set the time to 10:00 AM, name yourself A, say Y/Y/N/Y/Y to the Yes/No textboxes from mom

The correct manipped stats are 21/13/12/10/11/10.

Take Totodile’s Berry off, if not manipulating you might want to check stats (12 attack required?)

Go to Mr. Pokemon
Kill one Level 2 Pidgey, Level 2 Sentret or Level 3 Caterpie if you encounter one (only on the way to Mr. Pokemon, not worth on way back since you’ll take damage before the rival fight)

If you are doing manips, pick up the hidden potion after Mr.Pokemon
Otherwise, skip and buy 4 potions

Rival 1: Leer once, spam Scratch

go back to the lab, name rival 1 char, skip the catching tutorial

pick up coin case from above (IMPORTANT)
Equip Berry to Toto, Swap Toto with kenya
walk left 1, up 1, left 2
Open pokedex, scroll with right until bellsprout, open summary to hear its cry
use coin case
walk down, left, up
talk to red (press A)


Notes for coin case setup:
- Croconaw always needs to be 4th in part and its movesets needs to be Scratch/Leer/FuryCutter/WaterGun, in this specific order
- Either Egg or Kenya in 3rd is ~71% to work with random DVs (L6 Bellsprout is 71%*(12/16) to work, L3 Bellsprout never works
- TODO: check sandshrew chances

If you want to finish the run save after getting coin case, and if the glitch fails try different pokemons in slot3.
If it keeps failing, you might have messed up TID/box names, or you got really unlucky
