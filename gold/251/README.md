Todo
entrpntr
- new burned tower timing + suicune manip
- consider a few more routes/pokes + revisit balancing boxes
   - Route 8 w/o Repel (Noctowl/L15 Abra/Kadabra/Growlithe)
   - Machoke (Mt. Mortar or Rock Tunnel)
   - Route 4 w/L6 Repel (Jigglypuff, 25%)
   - Route 2 (Pikachu/Hoothoot/Spinarak/Noctowl/Ariados)
- refine backup for partyrekking
- add more clarity where needed (glitches + missing TM47s, etc.)
- start exploring the less major timesave opportunities (menus, party swaps & orders, etc.)
Entrpntr route
Right now, this is a slightly refined version of the route I used for my first completed run (https://www.twitch.tv/entrpntr/v/72301139). There are minutes HOURS LOL worth of refinements yet to be integrated.

Route skeleton
{before new game}
Aim for TID = 64960, using Livesplit as cue (adjust timings for reaction speed)
- Start+B+X = -12.507s; (Normal Hard Reset = -12.122s, emulator = -9.92s)
- Hold Start thru opening cutscenes
- Press A for New Game at 0.00s


{early game}
set time to saturday 10:00am
name your character A for proper passwords
reset female totos
can basically run any male totodile, except no perfect atk + def, or perfect spc + spd (avoid 0xFF for glitches later)
check stats, take berry off

kill encounters for experience
- 11 def: get at least 42xp for safety in violet gym
- 12 def: kill a L2 sentret/pidgey for water gun before union cave (if none show, kill something before ralph)

buy 6 potions in cherrygrove mart
- skip r29 berry; skip r30 potion + berry

rival (chikorita): leer x1 + scratch spam
back to prof elm, name rival 1 character


{r29-r30}
catch sentret on r29 (scratch x1 first; stall for a sentret if none shows up)

mikey:
pidgey: scratch x2 (rage if L7)
rattata: scratch x3 (rage if L7)

dodge don, but if he hits you:
- caterpie x2: rage spam (if L7), scratch spam (if L8)


{r31 + violet}

ralph: leer + scratch x3
get ralph's phone number after battle (talk to him)
dodge rotato


{union cave}
catch sandshrew if one shows up (scratch x1)

daniel (onix): wg if he hits you
- purposely fight daniel if you have bad stats; blitz him otherwise since his exp is still valuable
- need 169xp from spinners/encounters for L18 (croconaw) on bugsy, so kill encounters if you dodge daniel

russell (geodude x3): wg spam
dodge bill (koffing x2): wg spam if he hits you
ray (vulpix): wg + scratch or wg x2 if burn


{r33 + azalea}
potion before anthony if low health

rocket 1: wg x2-3 both rats (or scratch, depending on special)
rocket 2: wg x2-3 zubat, wg x3-4 ekans (or scratch both, depending on special)

josh (left side of gym w/paras):
- [no psn]: leer + scratch x2-3
- [psn]   : rage x3

if necessary, heal hp and status (do this immediately)

dodge benny, but if you hit him:
- weedle: wg

gastly: wg x2
bayleef: fury cutter x3 (send in another croc if one dies)
zubat: wg x2-3 (or scratch, depending on special)

do farfetch'd quest with shortest path (adds farfetch'd interaction, but saves steps so gengar/chansey hatch late enough).
repel when previous one runs out
teach cut to sentret at cut tree, cut from menu
skip getting headbutt
repel when previous one runs out
after exiting ilex, immediately go to daycare
save at daycare pc




>>> MAIN GLITCH SETUP BEGINS <<<

attempt bad clone
- reset a bit after closing the yes/no dialogue (power gamecube off/on if game boy player)
- see this video for proper timing: https://youtu.be/qFpJvSsiLEk?t=1h10m6s
- if box is full, switch to another box

once you get bad clone(s)
- check gender/stats on top L0 croc (if male or if species isn't glitched, it's fake bad clone)
- if first try bad clone (i.e. if first croc in box 2 is bad clone), clone one extra croc
- if only 1 bad clone, clone the bad clone
- move sentret in party to box 1 (below egg, to better distinguish from top sentrets)
- move bad clone to party
- move other bad clones to box 14
- if you have enough crocs, release any that gained stat exp on rival 2 (enough = 6, including clones, that didn't gain stat exp)
  --> intended to make it easier to troubleshoot if bad stat exp (i.e. mail), but might do opposite?
- if went past box 2 while cloning:
  - release all non-badclonemon in box 3+ (work backwards)
  - switch to box 2
- if you released crocs from party, withdraw enough crocs to get to a party of 6
- release all but 1 non-badclonemon in box 2

note: if the box where the bad clone was created becomes corrupted at any point, do not use the box for the rest of the run
- e.g. if box 2 becomes corrupt, use box 3 for 7 poke trick, use box 4 for sentret cloning, etc.

give bad clone to daycare woman, take back immediately (note: referred to as 'stabilizing' later)


{party bracing}
party menu:
- 3rd croc: click 'move', swap water gun to slot 3
- swap bad clone to front of party
move pkmn w/o mail:
- move croc in box 2 to front of party to get 7 pokemon
party menu:
- swap bad clone to 7th
- swap bad clone with first pokemon, then back to 7th (moves the FF into 7th pokemon name)
move pkmn w/o mail:
- scroll to 6th pokemon in party, press A twice (to move it in the same position, apparently does shit with nicknames)
- scroll to 1st pokemon in party, press A twice (same as above)

congrats you cannot corrupt pokedex flags unless you try really hard


{itemfinders}
deposit spam (deposit top 5 crocs in order)
use move pkmn w/o mail and move the first croc in box 2 to front of party
withdraw the last two crocs (4th and 5th in box)

- open the party menu
- if party menu locks up, do backup:
  - reset
  - deposit 2nd croc
  - use move pkmn w/o mail, move top croc to party
  - withdraw bottom 3 crocs
  - if primary backup fails, move another croc to party, but don't exceed 5 pokemon (need to withdraw to restore party terminator)
  - if exceed 5 pokemon:
    - use move pkmn w/o mail and move the unimportant crocs (so not the eggs etc.)
    - deposit spam again
    - move pkmn w/o mail save
    - don't do the final deposit setup thing, just go for the wdraw

deposit crocs if needed to get party size = 4 (3 crocs + bad clone)

leave house and fly to goldenrod

if you need to buy dratini, buy 2000 extra coins
buy abra+ekans and dratini if necessary (try to buy another ekans at the end to cancel out; slightly faster than saying NO)
if you don't have spearow, bike to r35 gate and get kenya from NPC
bike to daycare


{glitchless evos, box 10-11}
evolve abra, gloom, ekans, voltorb (+ kenya?)
move electrode to box 14 + deposit everything but mew

general idea:
- go through boxes 1 & 4-10
   - move any pokemon that need stones + zubat to box 12
   - move pokemon that evolve thru rare candies + L27 eevee into party until full party
   - evolve stuff in party with rare candies
   - deposit everything except mew
   - change to box 11 when box 10 is full


{stone/vitamin evos, box 12}
- Eevee x3
- Gloom
- Zubat (10 total vitamins + rare candies; minimize # of rare candies to evolve Golbat + Crobat)
- Sunkern
- Growlithe (if you need Suicune, rare candy Arcanine to L50 to learn Extremespeed after evolving)

{nodex farming, part 1}
deposit everything from party except mew
change to box 3
move all 3 sentrets (L1/L6/L12) into party
clone 3 sentrets
-
move L12 sentret into party
clone all 4 sentrets
-
move mew to box 14
move one L1 sentret + three L6 sentrets to top of box 14
-
do mass cloning of L1 sentrets and L12 sentrets
general idea:
  - first round of hatching will be Pichu + Vulpix/Igglybuff/Cleffa (these 4 are counted separately)
  - all other rounds of hatching will be one 1 egg cycle + four 0 egg cycle mons + filler poke
  - 26 mandatory sentrets + 4 bonus sentrets + 3 mandatory move mons + 6 bonus move mons = 39
  - 29-37 nodexes in total (miltank/tauros + scyther/pinsir removes 2 from total)
  - 1 egg cycle: 6-8 total; 0 egg cycle = 23-29 total
  - depending on what bonuses are needed, clone an appropriate amount of L1 and L12 sentrets to get 1:4 ratio (1:~3.9 if uneven)
  - rebalance boxes when needed: move L1 sentrets to box 1, move excess L12 sentrets to box 14 (under top 4 sentrets)


once everything is cloned, deposit sentrets in party (have to leave 1 in party temporarily)
change to box 2
withdraw 4 crocs

nodex cleffa w/L6 (gold berry; move egg to top of box 14, toss gold berries if any remain)

deposit crocs if necessary, party should be croc + bad clone + pichu egg
change to box 14
withdraw igglybuff/cleffa/vulpix eggs
walk out bottom of daycare, bike until eggs hatch (Pichu = L6, Vulpix = L35, Cleffa/Igglybuff = L38)
rare candy pichu to L10, use vitamins, rare candy to learn sweet kiss and evolve to pikachu
use vitamins + rare candies to evolve cleffa and igglybuff
use stones to evolve into Raichu/Ninetales/Clefable/Wigglytuff
swap bad clone to back
go back into daycare and go to pc
deposit Ninetales/Clefable/Wigglytuff

also move Cloyster (bonus = Tauros) + Arcanine (bonus = Suicune) to box 14, if need bonuses
change to box 2
withdraw 3 crocs

{nodex farming, move cases}
general setup:
  - give hm11 to pokemon that knows/will know the move
  - (Wobbuffet only) move counter to 3rd position (generally, already known moves can't be in first; this only affects wobbuffet tho)
  - 7 poke trick + move poke to 2nd + deposit spam + other crap
  - (Mew only) rare candy to L47, save, clone x1-3 if necessary (bonuses = Pinsir/Entei/Larvitar)
  - (Wobbuffet only) clone if necessary (bonus = Raikou)
  - (Mew only; to create Larvitar) rare candy to L82 (learn Ancientpower at L50)
  - (Mew only; to create Squirtle/Pinsir/Entei) teach TM/HM corresponding to poke
  - adjust move order and put the relevant move in first position
  - give & take pokemon to/from daycare
  - move poke to 2nd + bad clone to 1st + 7 poke trick (poke is now in 3rd)
  - deposit spam + other crap
  - if poke is 1 egg cycle, move to box 1; if 0 egg cycles, move to box 14

NOTE: for Larvitar, can stop rare candying Mew at L67 and exploit daycare egg experience glitch
  - daycare egg experience glitch involves looking at a medium fast poke's picture before giving to daycare
  - if you don't want to wrap your mind around that, just candy to L82, as that method is safer


[x] = # of egg cycles

Required
[1] Squirtle (Fire Punch) - Mew
[1] Politoed (Sweet Kiss) - Raichu
[0] Machamp (Counter) - Wobbuffet

Bonuses

NOTES
- If you get screwed by clicknicks (annoyingly long nicknames that involve mashing thru extra textboxes):
   - release the poke as soon as possible
   - move a fully evolved poke w/no stat exp from another box into the party to take its place
- Move L1 sentrets (1 egg cycle / no item) to box 1
- Move L12 sentrets (0 egg cycle / item) to box 14
- When convenient, rare candy a high leveled Croc to evolve into Feraligatr, then release the Feraligatr (move new poke into party)



{hatching}
after all nodexing party should be bad clone + crocs
give bad clone to daycare woman
deposit all but 1 croc
change to box 3
withdraw 4 sentrets
move pkmn w/o mail:
- croc in party to box 2
- move mew from box 1 to party
- move an egg from box 1 to front of party

general idea (ignore first 2 steps for first runthru, since we've done them already):
- withdraw 4 sentrets
- move an egg from box 1 to front of party
- leave daycare and bike until eggs hatch (should be ~30 seconds)
- evolve hatched pokes if necessary
- go back to daycare pc and deposit hatched pokes (if box 3 is full, move stuff into box 2)
- when box 3 has been taken care of, switch to box 14 to withdraw 0 egg cycle pokes from

> NOTE: when L0 squirtle hatches, give & take to/from daycare man and it will grow to L90; then use rare candies


{finale}
deposit everything except mew into box 14
withdraw sentretFF + electrode + L12 sentret
evolve L12 sentret into furret (should now have a completed pokedex)
deposit furret
give & take sentretFF to/from daycare man to turn it into hexFF
exit daycare & fly to new bark town
walk to water, surf with mew, and surf 2 tiles right
pokemon menu:
  - swap hexFF to front, swap electrode to 3rd
  - fly to indigo plateau
enter indigo plateau and immediately exit to set warp point
bike down into victory road and load rival fight
suicide to rival:
  - ball stall with hexFF
  - use random move with Mew
  - Selfdestruct/Explosion with Electrode
instant victory thru elite 4 + lance
soft reset before HOF after the save prompt is cleared (or wait a few seconds and listen to a Prof. Oak's badass 251 pokedex jingle)
use max repel + fly to Silver Cave
get on bike and bike towards Mt. Silver (Prof. Elm calls about an S.S. Ticket lol IDIOT)
navigate floor 1 in dark, bike thru floor 2+3 to get to red
instant victory red and hold B to spam thru credits
press A to continue
open save menu or pokedex to view pokedex completion status
timing ends when 251 is visible on the screen
optional:
  - go to pokedex and scroll right to prove you aren't a dirty cheater
  - if you haven't already, go to Silver Cave pokecenter and open Prof. Oak's PC to hear the jingle to end the run on a good note

[Bug Catching Contest Notes]
> Goal is to do 2 back-to-back passes through Bug Catching Contest, and managing that has some complications.
> Our keepers will be: (1) Paras, (2) Venonat or Weedle/Kakuna.
> In the first pass, we will leave when one of the following conditions is met:
    (1) Paras is caught,
    (2) Beedrill & Venonat are caught (keep the Venonat in this case; Paras will be our 2nd keeper).
> By the end of the second contest, we must either:
    (a) catch the entire Weedle family; aim for this option if you find a Beedrill (Paras/Venonat would be the two keepers)
    (b) catch Weedle/Kakuna (Paras/Kakuna would ideally be the two keepers)
    (c) catch Weedle (Paras/Weedle would be the two keepers)
> Even if we don't keep a Venonat, ideally we catch one; in this case, we make a detour to Route 25 in Kanto to catch Venomoth
> If we fail to encounter a single Venonat and it is the only thing left to grind, leave and catch on Route 25 (or Route 43?) later.
> Except the above case, grind the second pass until < 10% of encounters are pokes we don't own and/or can't evolve from pokes we own.
> Following the previous criteria, we will leave with at least one of Scyther/Pinsir.

potential TID mons:
- marill [b7]
	- possible options for evo are:
		- rare candy x18
		- hatching an azumarill
		- level corruption to evolve
		- modification of nickname nodex setup have a good level
- politoed [ba]
	- guaranteed to use the TID byte
	- sweet kiss options:
		- candying pichu to L11
		- forgoing a fast hatch for togepi (thru nickname corruption), then candying togepi to L18
		- candying smoochum to L9 (requires hatching a low level smoochum, then possibly using level corruption)
- suicune [f5]
	- extremespeed requires 32 candies or an exp shift (probably not doable)
	- suicune can be caught as a roaming mon (potential for suicune manip, spawns at R38)
	- could entirely skip legendary beasts
- larvitar [f6]
	- requires ancientpower which is non-trivial
	- 5% bonus in mt. silver/silver cave
	- evolves to tyranitar at L55 (40/45 candies), can also use level corruption

chalk nodexing with nickname mon:
- use HM03 & give items (either order)
- give & takeback three sentrets
- open party menu
- swap 3rd with 5th
- swap 6th with 2nd
- move mon
- move boxdummy between partydummy and sentret
- open party menu
- swap 2nd with 1st
- swap 7th with 6th
- swap 7th with 1st
- swap 7th with 6th
- swap 7th with 1st
- swap 1st with 7th
- swap 5th with 2nd
- open move mon
- move boxdummy to box
- move partydummy to top
- move sentrets to box
- withdraw three more sentrets

alternative strat: dupe nick sentretFDs ahead of time and set up the setup so that 01 lands in egg steps
- can either put 01 in happiness, then modify swaps so nick sentret is braced by partydummy
- or, keep current swaps and have species be determined by the 2nd character

- nickname nodex mon will be L100, can be averted by nodex egg already having a high level and bracing with partydummy, then using move mon to withdraw

chalk nodexing with nickname mon (BROKEN DUE TO RELIANCE ON TID of BAD CLONE):
- partydummy first
- bad clone 2nd
- three sentrets

- use HM03 & give items (either order)
- give & takeback three sentrets
- open party menu
- swap 3rd with 2nd
- swap 3rd with 6th
- move mon
- move boxdummy between partydummy and sentret
- open party menu
- swap 1st with 2nd
- swap 3rd with 7th
- swap 1st with 3rd
- swap 1st with 7th
- egg steps of 1st should be first TID byte of bad clone
- swap 6th with 2nd
- open move mon
- move boxdummy to box
- move partydummy to top
- move sentrets to box
- withdraw three more sentrets

level stuff:
bad clone 5th, non-evo 6th
move next evo into 4th

5/9
happiness = 6th char of OT3

general idea: partymon3 OT overlaps with happiness & level
abuse swaps with 7th pokemon to put a nickname into OT (7th OT = 1st nickname), then swap 3rd with 7th back and forth

SAVING. DON'T TURNOFF THE POWER.
I savedthe game.

49 frames = fast text
147 frames = medium text

4:7396

04:74fb swap moves

{fast saving}
to get fast saving text (and permanent fast text):
- during a 7 party setup while the first $ff is at or after daa0 (not sure), daa0 = wPartyMon3DVs+1, therefore the $ff mon generated after getting 7 pokemon should be moved to slot 4 and above (slot 4 has a potential softlock with HP)
- view the moves of the pokemon in the 7th slot (can really be any slot, just faster this way)
- scroll to the 125th pokemon (0 indexed). this pokemon should have pound and another move depending on the brightness value:
    - LIGHTEST [00]: DOES NOT WORK (no move)
    - LIGHTER [20]: horn drill
    - NORMAL [40]: peck
    - DARKER [60]: meditate
    - DARKEST [7F]: DOES NOT WORK (waterfall)
- swap pound with the 2nd move (SWAP MUST BE DONE IN THIS ORDER, CANNOT DO 2ND MOVE <> POUND)
- you now have fast saving text


{five chalk nodex with nickname, chained off previous setup}
NOTE: This setup has two extra swaps to give the nickname generated egg a glitched name for recognization
- use HM03 & give items (either order)
- give & takeback 4 sentrets (5, 4, 3, 1)
- swap 1st (bad clone) with 2nd (HM03)
- swap 2nd (bad clone) with 6th (sentretFD)
- access move mon menu
- move 1st (HM03) into box
- move nickname source into slot 1
- move HM03 into slot 1
- exit move mon menu
- open party menu
- swap 6th (sentretFD) with 1st (HM03)
- swap 1st (HM03) with 2nd (nickname source + FF)
- swap 7th (bad clone) with 6th (HM03)
- swap 6th (bad clone) with 1st (HM03)
- swap 1st (bad clone) with 7th (HM03)
- exit party menu
- access move mon menu
- move 1st (HM03, has glitched name) to storage
- move 5th (nickname source + FF) to 1st
- move remaining sentret eggs to storage
- move a new sentretFD to the top of the party
- move 2nd (nickname source + FF) to any box (closest possible)
- exit move mon menu
- open withdraw menu
- withdraw 3 more sentrets
- exit bill's PC

{five chalk nodex, chained off previous setup}
- give items
- give & takeback 5 sentrets
- swap 1st (bad clone) with 6th (sentretFD)
- access move mon menu
- move 1st (sentretFD) into box
- move dummy into slot 1
- move sentretFD (from earlier) into slot 1
- basic idea: move 3 sentretFDs below dummy (FF) above dummy (FF), without corrupting their species
	- move 3rd to 2nd
	- move 4th to 3rd
	- move 5th to 4th
- move 6th (sentretFD) into temp storage (same box as dummy probably)
- move dummy to top of party
- move sentretFD (from before) to top of party
- move 3rd to storage
- move 1st to storage
- move remaining sentret eggs to storage
- move a new sentretFD to the top of the party
- move 2nd (dummy) to its box
- exit move mon menu
- open withdraw menu
- withdraw 4 more sentrets
- exit bill's PC

Tyrogue Stats
It takes at most 8 proteins/irons to get all three evolutions at L20.

Tyrogue has base 35 atk and def, so stats are equal given same DV and stat exp (i.e. # of vitamins)

Rows = # of Proteins [or Irons]
Cols = Atk DV [or Def DV]
