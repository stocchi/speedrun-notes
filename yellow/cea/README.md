## Pokémon Yellow - Catch ‘em All Route
This is an adaptation of the route found [here](http://wiki.pokemonspeedruns.com/index.php?title=User:Eddaket/oobLG_Route), which uses the current No Save Corruption method to gain item underflow (also known as THE Manip). The route is written assuming the runner knows a lot of things, like how to perform the two NSC manips and has some knowledge about item underflow.

Before we start:
- Clear your save file.
  - This is mega important for reasons you’ll see later. Even if you don’t have a save file, still clear it. It’s required both by rule (no pre-existing save file) and for a glitch later on, which I’ll explain when the time comes
- Set your options to Fast/Off/Set
- Timing starts when you select New Game


### Intro
- Name yourself a one character name.
- Name your Rival /UUUUU. Case matters.
 - there are 5 “U”s, which means there should be one space left empty in the name

### Pallet Town
- Skip the PC Potion
- Get Pikachu and name it a one character name
- Rival: Thundershock
 - Winning or losing the rival fight doesn’t matter

### Viridian City
- Don’t fight any wild encounters as experience isn’t necessary
- Head to the PokéMart and receive Oak’s Parcel.
- On the way out of the city, heal at the Pokémon Center to set your spawn point to Viridian City.
- deliver Oak’s Parcel.
- Walk to the PokéMart and buy 4 Pokéball
- Backtrack to Route 1 to catch any Pokemon
  - Immediately chuck balls at L2-L4 Pidgeys
  - Weaken Rattatas and L5-7 Pidgeys with Thundershock before catching
- If you get a Pidgey or a L2-L3 Rattata, name it 'A', otherwise skip naming
  - this is needed for extended gust manip later

### Viridian Forest
- [Manipulate no encounter Forest](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDRDvVE3VN4)
  - 54/60 for the manip to work
- Make sure to not load the final Bug Catcher before the next manipulation
- End of manip is different from YNSC ("A" vs "ASH" affects the manip after picking up Potion)

## Deathfly Manip
- [Manipulate a L9 Pidgeotto encounter in front of the last Bug Catcher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DoPt1pxHPTo)
  - 47/60 for the manip to work
  - 11/60 for a L8 Pidgey (can still 0HKO depending on your Pokemon)
- Buffer down in move menu with all Pidgeys (works even without a 2nd move)
- Buffer select in move menu with all Rattatas
  - if you don't die first turn, spam a move until you die to get the deathfly glitch
- Same as YNSC

[OBSOLETE]Viridian City
Immediately head north again into Viridian Forest
Viridian Forest
All of the trainers will be deactivated, saving you a few steps in the grass. Walk through the forest, but catch an encounter (usually Caterpie, but anything will work). Continue on your way through the forest and leave, heading into Pewter City. On the off chance you got no encounters, or did not catch one, make sure you catch something on Route 2 after the forest. As a note, you will need a Pokéball left over, so don’t waste all of them. If you do, buy one in Pewter City
Pewter City
Head straight to the Pokémon Center but DO NOT HEAL. Instead, perform the Pika Offscreen Glitch:
Talk to the Jigglypuff next to the counter when walking at it from the left
Walk down 1, right 6 (enough so Pikachu is off screen)
Walk up 1
Walk down 2, up 2 16 or 17 times
Walk back to Pikachu and talk to him
If this was done correctly, the In Game Time (seen on the Trainer Card or in the Save screen) will read 255:59. If it doesn’t, just try again. Once your IGT is maxed out, deposit Pikachu in the PC and leave.
Walk to the PokéMart and talk to the shop owner
Buy
Escape Rope x1
After shopping, walk to the Pewter City Gym. Inside, you want to fight the first trainer HOWEVER, you need to make sure he sees you AND walks to you. This is important, or you’ll lock up your game. To do this, walk around the rocks on the right side and walk in between them. The trainer should see you
Jr. Trainer m
Diglett - Hope for a quick death
The point of this fight is to die as quickly as possible. It usually only takes two turns, so it shouldn’t be too bad. Once you die, you should spawn back in Viridian City


## THE Manip
- [Manipulate a specific movement pattern from the next NPCs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DonALfmjZOk)
	- 27/60 for the manip to work up to using the Town Map, hitting one of the first 4 textbox frames is ~81% for the bird to move left
- Stop Movement for ~6 frames to allow bird to start moving left, then hold right
- [Adjacent frames](http://pastebin.com/raw/qBT86ks0)
	- listed early to late, each is a 2 frame window, target = FE
	- use this to troubleshoot your failed manips
- Same as YNSC

Backup movement: backup options for wrong [NPC](https://gunnermaniac.com/pokeworld?map=1#53/182) movement without needing to re-save:

## Vermilion City
Enter the Pokémon Center and walk to the PC.
Deposit everything except Scyther and **CHANGE BOX!** to Box 2. Leave the center and bike to Route 6 to trigger a Trainer Fly. Catch the Mew that appears. After catching Mew, head to Diglett’s Cave

## Diglett’s Cave
Go down the ladder and catch a Diglett. Dugtrio is a possible bonus, but do not sit and wait for it

Once Diglett has been caught, move within one tile of the ladder. Open your item menu:
- Swap 6F x1 with []o[] at the bottom of your inventory
 - If your Diglett is under level 19, use Rare Candies from the top stack until it learns Dig

- Leave the PokéMart to warp to Seafoam Islands

## Seafoam Islands
Immediately go down the ladder you appear on. All we need to catch here is Krabby and Articuno. Everything else is a bonus. Here’s a list of each Pokémon and how to catch them:
- Cave encounters: Golbat, Zubat, Krabby, Kingler, Seel, Dewgong
- Super Rod: Staryu, Krabby, Kingler
- Surfing/Water JACK: Tentacool, Staryu
- Articuno: Articuno

Typically, I will get an encounter as I walk over to Articuno. I then hop on the bike, Jack through to get to Articuno, and while I’m stuck on the Water Tile, I get one encounter there and catch it. I then grab Articuno, and make sure I get Krabby

If Articuno goes to your party, swap him to the front. Once you have the compulsory Pokémon, dig out

Enter the Pokémon Center. Open your item menu:
- Swap Iron x1 in your inventory with v_t_m in Map Data (3 slots below warping)
- Swap Roaming TMs with Master Ball in warping and toss 190
- Swap Ultra Ball x0 in Brightness with Soulbadge in Rival Name
- Swap 0x76 in Rival Name with Parlyz Heal x94 in your inventory
- Swap HP Up with 4 in Text Pointer
- Scroll up to Great Ball x1 above warping
- Exit the Center to warp to Cinnabar Island

## Cinnabar Island
Immediately open your item menu:
- use the Bicycle your cursor is on
- Bike to the tile 2 below the Gym door
- Open your item menu
- Swap X Defend x86 in your inventory with Helix Fossil in Text Pointer
- Bike to the PokéMart sign and talk to it three times to receive three Eevee.
- After getting three Eevee, bike to Cinnabar Lab. Open your item menu
- Swap Antidote x84 (cursor should be on it) with Master Ball in warping
- Toss Antidote x1
- Leave the lab to warp to Power Plant

## Power Plant
Here, the only Pokémon required is Zapdos, however Voltorb is free and it’s pretty easy to get one of Grimer or Magnemite. Magneton and Muk are decent bonuses as well.

Talk to Zapdos and catch it. Then Jack through the wall and head toward the entrance. The first item ball on the right (through a wall) is a Voltorb, so catch that if you haven’t yet. Then walk down, catch the Pokémon you want, and stop on the doormat. Open your item menu:
- Swap the top stack of Rare Candy with HM03 in Rival Name
- Toss Rare Candy x67 to get 188
- NOTE: If you used Rare Candies to get Diglett to level 19, subtract that number from the toss (e.g. if you had a level 17 Diglett and used 2 Rare Candies, only toss 65)
- Swap Ultra Ball x0 in Rival Name with Parlyz Heal x94 in Rival Name
- Swap Ultra Ball x0 with Moon Stone x22 under warping
- Swap Ultra Ball x0 with Master Ball x83 in warping
- Toss Ultra Ball x21
- *Maybe Horsea LG*
- Leave the Power Plant to warp to Silph Co.

## Silph Co.
Walk up 1, down 1 to re-enter the teleporter. DO NOT WALK DOWN. Talk to the man to receive a Lapras. Dig out

Enter the Pokémon Center and walk to your PC. If you do not have Articuno in your party, deposit something and withdraw Zapdos. In either case, **CHANGE BOX!** to Box 3. If you withdrew Zapdos, swap him to the front of your party now. Exit the center. Open your item menu:
- Swap Moon Stone x22 in Rival Name with Helix Fossil in your inventory
- Toss Moon Stone x3
- Swap v_t_m with TM43 x4
- Swap 0x76 with 6F
- Toss all Dire Hits
- Use the Bicycle
- Bike to Route 11

## Route 11
On Route 11, you can catch Pidgey, Pidgeotto, Rattata and Drowzee. The way this area works is this: You need to perform two LGs. To perform an LG, follow these steps:
- Get a wild encounter
- Use 6F
- Hit Start
- Open your item menu
- Use v_t_m
- Go to the LG location
- Flash the item 4
- Use Master Ball
- Use Master Ball again to catch Ditto (do this only on the first LG)
- Save and Reset

Typically, what I will do is grind encounters until I get an encounter I already have and do the next LG. I won’t catch Pidgeotto unless I have a Pidgey, as I’ll either need to get Pidgey AND Pidgeot later, or evolve a Pidgey through Pidgeotto to get to Pidgeot. It’s up to you.

The two Pokémon you need in LG are Hitmonchan (tile is here) and Growlithe (tile is here).  After catching Growlithe, bike up to this trainer and battle him (Peck/Drill Peck)

After fighting the Gambler, be very careful. You need to get to Route 12 without encountering another Wild Pokémon or trainer battle. It is possible to get from the Gambler to this tile without entering grass or fighting a trainer, so do so. Once at that tile, Jack through the wall and enter the gatehouse. Walk through the gatehouse to the other side. On the other side, walk to the right and trigger a Trainer Fly. You should encounter Missingno. If you don’t, a few things could have gone wrong:
You did not clear your save file before starting the run
Vulpix was not the last Pokémon you fought
You messed up the PC Underflow segment

If you did encounter Missingno, catch it. After the battle, immediately save and reset. Once you load, walk back to the gatehouse and re-enter Route 12

## Route 12
Bike to the Snorlax. Open your item menu
- Swap 4 with Water Stone x5
- Use PokéFlute in Money
- Catch the Snorlax.

After the battle, bike to the water and use your Super Rod. You need to catch a Horsea, but Seadra is a nice bonus as well. Once you have Horsea, re-enter the gatehouse and walk to the tile to the right of the left-top doormat.
Open your item menu
- Swap 6F with 0x76
- Swap PokéFlute in Money with Ultra Ball x0 in Brightness
- Swap Master Ball in Warping with Roaming TMs
- Walk out the door to the left to warp to Victory Road

## Victory Road
Open your item menu:
toss the Master Ball you’re on to bring the cursor up to the Bicycle and use it. Immediately go down the ladder. Here, all you need are Geodude and Moltres. Geodude is common enough that you shouldn’t need to grind too hard for it. You can also catch Graveler, Zubat, and Onix, but they are too rare to be worth searching for. Once you have the compulsory Pokémon, dig out

Enter the Pokémon Center. Open your item menu
- Swap Ultra Ball x0 in Brightness with Master Ball in warping
- Toss Ultra Ball x240
- Exit the Center to warp to Route 5

## Route 5
Walk over to and enter the Underground Path entrance. On the door mat, open your item menu:
- Swap the glitch item below your cursor ($88$ from now on) with Coin Case in TID
- Swap $88$ with []x[] x[]2 in Options
- Swap Helix Fossil in Rival Name with 6F in your inventory
- Swap Moon Stone with HM03
- Swap the top stack of Rare Candy with Master Ball at the top of your inventory
- Toss Rare Candy x47
- Swap []o[] with Super Rod
- Swap Super Rod with Rare Candy at the bottom of your inventory
- Swap Helix Fossil with Ultra Ball x0 in Brightness
- Walk out. Fly to Pewter City

## Pewter City
Enter the Pokémon Center and exit immediately. Open your item menu:
- Swap Potion x0 below warping with Ultra Ball x0 in Money
$88$ is a 4-click item
- Enter the Pokémon Center again and walk to the PC
- Open your item menu (not in the PC)
- Swap Ice Heal x0 in X Position with Ultra Ball x0 in Brightness
- Walk 2 left, 2 down
- Swap Ice Heal x0 with Master Ball x2 in warping
- Swap Ice Heal x0 with []x[] x0 in X Position
- Toss Dire Hit x2 from Dire Hit x34 in Map ID
- Swap HM04 below with TM43 x4 in your inventory
- Swap HM04 with []o[] in Badges
- Swap Master Ball x2 in Brightness with Ultra Ball x0 in your inventory
- Open your options menu and set Battle Style to Shift

Your inventory should look like this:
- Master Ball
- Rare Candy x208
- Rare Candy x255
- []o[]
- Water Stone
- v_t_m
- 0x76
- Ice Heal
- 4
- Fire Stone
- Leaf Stone
- Thunderstone
- []o[]
- HM03
- Master Ball x2
- Moon Stone x19
- Bicycle
- Super Rod
- Money - Potion x0
- Rival Name - Super Potion x93
- Rival Name - Super Repel x93

- Options - $88$
- Badges - HM04
- TID1 - Master Ball
- TID2 - []x[]
- Brightness - Ultra Ball x0
- Map ID - Dire Hit x32
- TM43 x4
- Ice Heal x0
- Warping - []x[] x0

## oobLG
You’re now all set up for oobLG. You may want to save now. Here’s the steps to take for each Pokémon:
- Face up and your open item menu
- Scroll down and toss Rare Candies in Rival Name to the desired Pokémon index number (see table below) (first Pokémon is all set)
- Scroll down so 6F is 3rd on screen, $88$ is 4th
- Mash A on 6F to use it, which will open the PC
- Open Bill’s PC (first time, deposit all your Pokémon except one in Box 3 and withdraw Rhydon and Hitmonchan. Change to Box 4 and deposit Rhydon and Hitmonchan in that order)
- Open the Withdraw menu
- View Hitmonchan’s stats and back out to the main Bill’s PC menu
- Open the Withdraw menu again
- Select Master Ball<junk>, but Mash B to exit out of the PC all together without selecting anything
- A battle should start with the Wild Pokémon you are looking for
- Open the item menu in the battle. A Master Ball will be automatically thrown
- Once the battle finishes, you can repeat the steps.

Important tips to consider:
- You want to catch 5 Pokémon in a row, evolve with the stack of Rare Candies in slot 3 of your inventory (don’t forget Stones too!) and deposit them, and then catch more
You can also evolve using the Rare Candies, you’re supposed to toss.
- Everything evolves in 1 Rare Candy (2 for two stage Pokémon), so it can be a useful timesave
- After you use 6F for the 12th time (or after you catch 12 Pokémon using this) do this:
- Perform steps 1-5 above
- Deposit all Pokémon in your party except one
- Withdraw Rhydon and Hitmonchan
- Change to the next box
- Soft Reset immediately after changing, however a Hard Reset is required to actually reboot the game
- Soft Reset is used so you don’t accidentally Hard Reset too early
- When the game reloads, perform steps 1-5 above
- Deposit Rhydon and Hitmonchan in that order
- Perform steps 6-11 and repeat as usual
- There are two Pokémon (Kabuto and Dratini) that are obtained with a slightly different method that I’ll explain later. They can be obtained at any point in this segment, but I suggest doing them last for two reasons
- If you accidentally close Bill’s PC after checking Hitmonchan’s stats, and then you keep going, you’ll get a Kabuto for the encounter, which you can catch
- Dratini requires a big swap that you’d have to do and undo, which wastes time

Here is a list of the Pokémon you’ll get. Black Pokémon you will always get, which Blue Pokémon are conditional based on how the earlier run went:

Once that’s done, you can catch the two remaining bloockoobLG Pokémon:
- Kabuto
- Use the PC without 6F
- Do the same menus as an oobLG
- Dratini
- Swap HM03 from your inventory with Super Potion x93
- Use the PC without 6F
- Start doing the same menus as an oobLG, however:
- If Master Ball’s name is corrupted when you enter the Withdraw menu, flash his menu and close out
- Otherwise, do the same menus as an oobLG
- Evolutions and The End
-After getting Dratini (should be the last oobLG Pokémon), open your item menu
- Swap Rare Candy with 4
- Swap Parlyz Heal in Rival Name with Ultra Ball x0 in Brightness
- Scroll up and evolve things

Try to make your first evolution in a single Rare Candy or Stone. After evolving the first Pokémon, your sound will disappear and you’ll be in Overworld Red Bar, that persists until you leave the map. Continue to evolve everything. Once everything has been evolved, deposit all but one Pokémon. Open your item menu:
- Swap 0x76 with Dire Hit x32 in Map ID
- Use v_t_m in Text Pointer (usually a 1-click item)

If you did everything correctly, you should be in the Hall of Fame with 151 Pokémon! Timing ends when the game fades to white after receiving your Pokédex rating, before credits
